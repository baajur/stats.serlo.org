# MfNF-Collaborator-Numbers
Generates an overview of all collaborators and their edits for the Wikibooks-project ["Mathe f√ºr Nicht-Freaks"](https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathe_f%C3%BCr_Nicht-Freaks). This is based on the [sitemap](https://de.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Mathe_f%C3%BCr_Nicht-Freaks:_Sitemap)

Usage: just run via command-line and python3 or use individual functions from the code

Idea:
Via the sitemap that we can scrape, we can access all articles from different subjects. There we scrape the editing-history of the pages (download it first in /wiki, because otherwise the code would be too slow) and create a dictionary per topic (or a general one) with {author-name : List of editing-events}. These events have the following form: (article-name, date). With this basis we can filter the dictionary via the date-attribute and get the collaborator-numbers and -names for the last xy days.
